## Core Principles

- Listening events are immutable facts.
- Raw input is preserved whenever lossless capture is possible.
- Identity is provisional and converges over time.
- Canonical correctness is non‑blocking.
- Ambiguity is preserved early and resolved explicitly later.
- All background work is explicit, bounded, and inspectable.
- No process runs continuously or implicitly.
